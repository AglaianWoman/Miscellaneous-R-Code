Miscellaneous R Code
====================

Miscellaneous R and possibly other code that might be useful to others for learning/demonstration purposes.  Some are related to fitting of various models, others specific to short courses and technical reports I put together, and possibly just some random shenanigans.  It may also include data sets at some point.
